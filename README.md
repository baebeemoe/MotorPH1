# MotorPH1

You need to design a class diagram for your MotorPH Employee App, keeping in mind the concepts that you have learned earlier. Consider the following when designing your class diagram:

What are the different objects existing in the context of MotorPHâ€™s employee dataset? 
Which of my existing classes in my program are coupled together such that there may be two objects in a single class? 
Based on the given dataset, what should be my attributes for each of my classes? How should these attributes be accessed? Private or public?
Do I have getter and setter methods for my attributes?
What methods should I include based on the given requirements of MotorPH Employee App?
